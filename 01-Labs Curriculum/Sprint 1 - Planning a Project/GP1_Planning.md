## Purpose

Before you can start development, you need to know what you're developing. This requires planning and knowing what your client wants. As you begin the process of breaking down a development slate into individual tasks, you'll be thinking in terms of user stories.

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the user's perspective. For example:

* "As a user, I can back up my entire hard drive."
* "As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need to have saved."

## Lesson

Your instructor will accompany you through an IWY loop (I do, We do, You do) in today's guided project. Here's what to expect:

### *I Do*

#### Getting acquainted with user stories

* Your instructor walks you through the what, how, and why of user stories.
  
#### Application walkthrough

* Your instructor takes you through the AllTrails web application and asks for your participation via Slack to help identify the user stories you see.

### *We Do*

#### Exploring an application

* Your instructor will give you a list of several web applications. You'll be given a few minutes to write down as many user stories as you can find. Take note of where you found each user story (what page, where on the page, etc.).

#### Reviewing student examples

* Your instructor pulls up a few student-sourced examples of user stories and offers feedback.
  
#### Breaking down a product roadmap into user stories

* Your instructor opens up Citrics product roadmap and creates Trello cards for each user story.

#### Adding supplemental tasks to user stories

* Your instructor uses the Citrics product to demonstrate how to go about breaking down a user story into a checklist of technical tasks to accomplish.

### *You Do*

#### Breaking down a single user story

* In breakout rooms, you'll be given a user story (for example, "As a judge, I can individually score a project"). With your group, you'll determine what technical tasks are required to perform that particular function.
  
#### Reviewing student examples

* Your instructor uses a few student examples of technical task breakdowns to discuss and provide feedback.
