## Purpose

Architecture is a prerequisite for any product development planning.

A top-level concept of the system's required functions is broken down into sub-functions; the most abstract version of its physical form is broken down into subsystems capable of performing the sub-functions, and so on for other types of breakdowns.

## Lesson

Your instructor will accompany you through an IWY loop (I do, We do, You do) in today's guided project. Here's what to expect:

### *I Do*

#### What's an architecture breakdown?

* Your instructor discusses the mechanics of an architecture breakdown, its utility, and what you'll be accomplishing.

### *We Do*

#### Reviewing product requirements

* Your instructor takes a product roadmap and reviews the product requirements with you.

#### High-level architecture diagram

* Guiding class participation via Slack, your instructor creates a component diagram and data flow diagram, incorporating your suggestions.

#### Technical details

* Your instructor walks you through the frameworks and libraries to use. Constraints, standards, site management, and scaffolding will also be discussed.

#### API Contracts

* Your instructor discusses what it means to put together an API contract, then models how to diagram your resources and determine what operations will be available for those resources.

#### Data model

* Your instructor will identify models, discuss normalization, and create a database schema for the product.

### *You Do*

#### Working as a team

* Your instructor will direct you to spend time working on your architecture as a team.

## After Class

Take a few minutes to review the principles you've learned. What questions do you still have? Remember, your instructors, TPLs, and Labs Support Hours are here to help. Don't hesitate to reach out.
