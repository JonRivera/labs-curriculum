## Schedule

Here's an overview of our guided project schedule today.

| <ins>Time</ins>  | <ins>Activity</ins>     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| 05 mins      | **Why present your work?**          |

## Purpose

Telling your story does more than just let future employers know who you are -- it's a record of what you've done, what you've learned, and can give a sense of the professional you've become.

A well-crafted blog post can enhance your visibility and signal to hiring managers (in a more detailed way) your professional journey, with all its challenges and victories.

Put yourself out there! They can't find you if you're not out there.

## Lesson

Your instructor will accompany you through an IWY loop (I do, We do, You do) in today's guided project. Here's what to expect:

#### Find your favorite blog

### *You Do*

#### Your tasks
