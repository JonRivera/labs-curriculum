## Hiring Manager Inspiration

Here are some quotes from hiring managers about presenting work:

"Weâ€™re looking for candidates with evidence of strong writing/communication skills, having created multiple projects during their education that are thoughtfully displayed in some way (blog, github, anything) and personal passion from them about our company/mission."

"Weâ€™re looking for candidates with a learning mindset and enthusiasm for sharing knowledge and interests."

"We love to see passion and a desire to continue learning, to work with cool technologies, to fill gaps in their knowledge."

## Prompt 1 - Curating your blog

This week, you spent your inquiries writing sections of a blog post. For your sprint challenge, go through your entire blog post, make any necessary edits, and publish it. Your blog post should include:

- A background section (which you completed on Monday)
- A technical challenges section (which you completed on Tuesday)
- A results and future implications section (which you completed on Wednesday)

Make sure to have interesting subtitles (don't just say "Background") and a consistent writing style. Publish your blog before 11 am and submit a link to the blog as your sprint challenge.

## Prompt 2 - Share your blog (Optional)
