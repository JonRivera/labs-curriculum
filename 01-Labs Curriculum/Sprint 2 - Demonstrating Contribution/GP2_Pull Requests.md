## Purpose

Pair programming involves two programmers working together at one station: the driver writes code while the other, an observer/navigator, reviews the code as it's written. The driver and navigator switch roles frequently.

In addition to reviewing the code as it's written, the navigator also considers the strategic direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvement and anticipating potential future problems. The objective of pair programming is to free the driver to focus their attention solely on completing the task itself, relying on the navigator as a safety net and guide.
