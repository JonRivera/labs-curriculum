## Purpose

Giving feedback is part of working with a team. Each of us is constantly giving feedback to one another simply by the way we respond in conversation. Knowing how to go about giving feedback in a thoughtful, productive, and intentional way is more than a useful life skill, it's a vital tool in any workplace environment.

Guess what's even harder than giving feedback: receiving feedback. You worked hard on it, so watching someone critique your work product hurts. It feels personal -- but it doesn't have to. You'll be receiving feedback for as long as you find yourself in a workplace (from colleagues, managers, clients, etc.), so learning how to receive it gracefully will serve you throughout your career.

## Lesson

Your instructor will accompany you through an IWY loop (I do, We do, You do) in today's guided project. Here's what to expect:

### *I Do*

#### Giving and receiving feedback

* Your Career Specialist gives a presentation on what it means to give and receive feedback properly.

### *We Do*

#### Feedback demonstration

The Engineering Manager and Product Manager demonstrate giving and receiving feedback.

#### Debrief

* Your Career Specialist leads a discussion on the good and bad of the feedback demonstration.

#### Breakout rooms

* Your Career Specialist sends you into breakout rooms in groups of four. You receive a scenario and characters to inhabit during this feedback session, writing feedback from your character's perspective. Link to your feedback document in Slack.

#### Breakout debrief

* Your Career Specialist reviews several of the documents and offers feedback.

#### Feedback form

* Your instructor introduces the feedback form and talks through the feedback guide, drawing from examples of previous Labs feedback that illustrates positive and not so positive examples.

### *You Do*

#### Going over the inquiry

* Your instructor discusses the inquiry questions and what you should be focusing on.
