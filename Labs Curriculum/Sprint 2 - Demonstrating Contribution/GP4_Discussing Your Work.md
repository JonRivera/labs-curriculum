## Purpose

From a hiring manager perspective, the ability to discuss the reasoning and technical decision-making behind the work is just as important as the work itself.

Taking time to consider and practice responding to likely hiring manager questions is just as vital as the time spent assembling a portfolio.

## Lesson

Your instructor will accompany you through an IWY loop (I do, We do, You do) in today's guided project. Here's what to expect:

### *I Do*

#### Talking about what you built

* Your instructor discusses what hiring managers are looking for when they ask candidates to talk about what they built.

### *We Do*

#### Hiring manager questions

* Your instructor guides class participation via Slack in assembling a number of questions hiring managers could ask about your individual contribution.

#### Mock interview

* Your instructor interviews a student about their project and features they built:
  * "Tell me about a project you worked on."
  * "What did you specifically build on the project?"
  * "Can you show me what you built?"
* During the interview, the instructor has the student pull up their project or repo and walk through it.

#### Breakout room write-up

* In breakout rooms, in groups of four, you're given a set of interview questions. One student in the group pulls up their work and everyone writes answers to the following questions about that work:
  * "Tell me about a project you worked on."
  * "What specifically did you build on the project?"
  * "Can you show me what you built?"
* For the last question, students should link screenshots and code snippets.

### *You Do*

#### Going over the inquiry

* Your instructor discusses the inquiry questions and what you should be focusing on.
