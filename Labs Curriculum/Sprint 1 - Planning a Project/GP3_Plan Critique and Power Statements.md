## Purpose

Everything at Lambda is engineered to prepare you for your future job. Framing your learning in the context of its application on the job or in a hiring manager interview should serve as a vital reminder of your trajectory.

Recontextualizing your user story task breakdowns as an exercise in interview prep serves as an excellent example of how we want you to reimagine the real-world relevance of all the work you do here.

## Lesson

Your instructor will accompany you through an IWY loop (I do, We do, You do) in today's guided project. Here's what to expect:

### *I Do*

#### Reviewing key takeaways

* Your instructor takes a few minutes to review the key points and takeaways from our guided project on user stories and planning.

### *We Do*

#### Reviewing Trello boards

* Your instructor picks three teams and reviews their Trello boards as a group exercise.

#### Hiring manager questions

* Your instructor guides class participation via Slack in assembling a number of questions hiring managers could ask about the thinking and technical decision-making behind your task breakdown process.

#### Speaking about your process

* Your Career Specialist reiterates what constitutes a power statement.
* Your instructor and a Career Specialist encourage you to write up a few bullet points detailing your own process breakdown.
* In front of the class, your instructor uses the content in a student Trello board to create several resume power statements with the Career Specialist, asking a number of questions:
  * "Describe a project you worked on?"
  * "How did you break down your tasks? What aspects of the project did you have clear ownership of?"
  * "How did you divide up work to deliver on time?"
  * "What were the results or outcomes of dividing the project the way the team did? Was this process effective?"
* Your instructor may also use some student-curated questions. Don't forget to write your own questions based on your task breakdown.

### *You Do*

#### Going over the inquiry

* Your instructor discusses the inquiry questions and what you should be focusing on.
