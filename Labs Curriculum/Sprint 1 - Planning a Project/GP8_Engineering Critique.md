## Purpose

Everything at Lambda is engineered to prepare you for your future job. Framing your learning in the context of its application on the job or in a hiring manager interview should serve as a vital reminder of your trajectory.

Recontextualizing your user architecture breakdown as an exercise in interview prep serves as an excellent example of how we want you to reimagine the real-world relevance of all the work you do here.

## Lesson

Your instructor will accompany you through an IWY loop (I do, We do, You do) in today's guided project. Here's what to expect:

### *I Do*

#### Reviewing key takeaways

* Your instructor takes a few minutes to review the key points and takeaways from our previous guided project on engineering.

### *We Do*

#### Hiring manager questions

* Your instructor guides class participation via Slack in assembling a number of questions hiring managers could ask about the thinking and technical decision-making behind your architecture breakdown.

#### Speaking about your process

* Your instructor picks three teams and conducts a review of their architecture documents for the class, asking questions like:
  * ‚ÄúDescribe a technical choice you made.‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúGiven the decision you made, what do you feel are some of the risks?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWhat challenges do you foresee with the architecture your team selected?‚Äù
* Your instructor may incorporate some student-curated questions as well, offering tips and feedback on responding to these sorts of questions.

### *You Do*

#### Going over the inquiry

* Your instructor discusses the inquiry questions and what you should be focusing on.
