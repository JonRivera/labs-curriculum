## Purpose

An Income Share Agreement is a legally binding document. It's important that you understand what's required of you and how it will affect your finances.

Lambda School was founded on the belief that while potential is evenly distributed across society, opportunity is not. Our Income Share Agreement (ISA) allows us to provide an education that usually costs tens of thousands of dollars for no upfront cost, without debt, loans, or interest. As you make payments toward your ISA after graduation, remember that you‚Äôre helping to fund the Lambda experience for the next student.
